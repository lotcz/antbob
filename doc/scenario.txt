STORY
=====

Anthill is under a lockdown because of unknown disease killing all insects. Bob and Alice can't go outside to play and are bored.
Alice convince Bob to open a tunnel to the playground to find Bob's cousin. There, Bob meets the sick bee and when he returns to the anthill, everyone gets sick.
Bob is then cast out and must find a cure.

Bob meets Reds - red ants living in tee-pees, sworn enemies of the black ants.
Reds do not suffer from the disease and offer a help to Bob if he first help them with humans camping in the area.

He must get a liquid-holding backpack, suck tree sap in it and spill it over a toast in a food box.
He must put cigarettes off by pushing it off the table first and then using Bigfoot to push it into a pond.

As a reward, Reds show Bob where to get cedar resin to cure the anthill.
Bob must transport the resin on the Bigfoot to the Playground to crush it into pieces.

Bob bring piece of resin to the Queen who is under attack of a centipede (guard ants are sick).
Bob defeats centipede, give queen a cure and wins.
